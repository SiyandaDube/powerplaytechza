    <center><h2 style="color: white;">EXPLOSIVE ACCELERATE ARCHETYPE</h2></center>
    <center><p style="color:white;">Title Update introduces the following change for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC: </p></center>
    <center><p style="color:white;"><em>Players with the Explosive AcceleRATE archetype now accelerate slightly faster during the early stages of a requested sprint.</em></p></center>
    <center><p style="color: white;">One of our goals with AcceleRATE is to better capture the diversity we see in real world player movement,<br>with the intent of increasing the viability of different player types in FIFA 23.</br>To that end, we’re making Explosive type players a little<br> quicker off the mark, when they’re requested to sprint.</br></p></center>
    <center><p style="color: white;">Here’s an example of how an Explosive player could have sprinted before title update, compared to Lengthy and Controlled players.</p></center>

            JOCKEYED INTERCEPTIONS
        </h3>
    </center>
    <center><p style="color: white;">Title Update introduces the following change:</p></center>
    <center><p style="color: white;"><em>When intercepting the ball while jockeying, the player is now better able to take control of the ball instead of it bouncing away from the player.</em></p></center>
    <center>
        <p style="color: white;">
            With this change, we’re looking to ensure that players who excel at reading the game are better able to turn their understanding into action on the virtual pitch.

        </p>
    </center>
    <center><p style="color: white;">However, please note that this change doesn’t mean that every single jockeyed interception will be successful.<br>Pass interceptions continue to rely on a variety of factors such as player</br>Attributes, positioning, ball travel speed, and more. Here’s how an<br>interception while jockeying could have looked like <em>Before</em> title update:</p></center>

    <center><p style="color: white;">Notice how the player wasn’t able to take control of the ball even though they did what they could to intercept.<br>Now let’s take a look at how this interception could play out after title update:</p></center>
